A command-line application coded in Java with back-end data processed and stored in PostgreSQL.

Features such as requesting/managing friends, creating/modifying/sharing stock lists containing stocks, buying/selling stock on portfolio and generating statistics (beta, COV, covariance and correlation matrices) are implemented with mostly SQL in the back-end instead of pulling them to Java for efficiency.

### How to use

1. Before running, create a database on any platform you like (cloud platform/local postgreSQL application) called "mydb". 
2. Create all the tables required to store data using the code in the document "main/create.sql".
3. Go to the file "main/pgsample/src/main/java/cs/toronto/edu/utils/Helper.java", change the line "**conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:postgresql://34.122.21.19:5432/mydb", "postgres", "postgres");**" with the correct IP address and the port number.
4. Run the program, you can do this by running the file "main/BuildAndRun.sh". If you are running your database locally, you can also do this by running the file "main/pgsample/src/main/java/cs/toronto/edu/Main.java".
